# about me
first-paragraph: I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas A&M University</a>, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.
second-paragraph: I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saigon, Vietnam</a>, and was fortunate to spend my most memorable time at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNU-HCM_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted</a> (informatics program of 2020) and previously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%E1%BA%A7n_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i_Ngh%C4%A9a_High_School_for_the_Gifted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TƒêN Secondary School for the Gifted</a> (mathematics program of 2017) with very good friends - too many to name them here, where we played football (soccer) on concrete fields together afterschool.
research-introduction: I do research in robotics, mainly focusing on applying <code>cognitive architectures to robotic grasping</code> to enable robots with a closely similar human grasping capability. Just imagine the robot enters the kitchen, finds a banana, grasps without crushing it, and brings it back to you.

research-interests:

  - field: Robotic Perception
    subfields: semantic scene understanding, perception for grasping
  
  - field: Robotic Manipulation
    subfields: learning to grasp, manipulative visual-motor skills
